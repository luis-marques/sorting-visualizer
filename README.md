# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer



It includes the following sorting algorithms:

* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Selection Sort
* Heap Sort
* Bitonic Sort
* Counting Sort

## Animation Speed

There's a slider which enables the user to control the animation speed as he wishes. This can be used to more carefully visualize some algorithms, or to speed up sorts that take in larger inputs. However, the time taken to sort an array should *NOT* be considered representative of the selected algorithms' complexity, as different amounts of delay were added to each algorithm. For that purpose, the **Time Complexity** of each algorithm is displayed while sorting takes place. 

## Acknowledgments

This application was built using the **p5.js JavaScript library**, for which *The Coding Train* was a great learning resource.
